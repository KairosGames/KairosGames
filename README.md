# Hello to you dear visitor,  
  
  

First of all, I welcome you on my Itch.io (and GitHub) page and I sincerely hope that you will find pleasure here by playing to my games because I took care of them for that (here is my Itch.io page : kayrosgames.itch.io/).   

I am an actor in reconversion in the field of videogame programming. Having tried my hand at several fields, I have what we could call an atypical background that makes me a multi-skilled person.  

After obtaining my Master of research in Philosophy, with the production of a thesis on the theme of video games (co-directed by Mathieu Triclot), I worked as an actor for several years and I was lucky enough to participate in more than ten shows. I think I have talent in comedy, because I work hard, and also because I have a certain sensitivity. But the difficulty to live well from this profession, in addition to the pandemic, made me decide to find a field where I could have a decent living.  

Since the recruitment of programmers has been on the rise for a long time, and more and more, but also to stay in an artistic field, video games appeared to me as a possible suitable field. Although it is not the field that recruits the most in the informatic industry, learning to program for video games will always allow me to branch out if needed. Moreover, I was brought up on video games. I got my first console (a Game Boy Color) at the age of five, and it was the beginning of a long love story.  

After some researchs, I spotted a training program offered by the Cnam-Enjmin Nouvelle-Aquitaine, a three-year programming science degree "video games course", in work-study. This training seemed to be the most appropriate to my situation but the problem was that the selection is hard and that you have to find a work-study program in a company to be accepted, even though I had no programming background.  

So I rolled up my sleeves, and started at the beginning of September 2021 to learn to program with the Python language. I had fun making small playful programs but I quickly decided to follow a four-month certification training delivered by Gaming Campus (in partnership with Gamecodeur) in order to have the necessary level for the Enjmin and a chance to get an apprenticeship contract (this training cost me 2800‚Ç¨, which were at my own expenses). Even though the course was very demanding (not everyone succeeded) - and I had to be careful with tendonitis that can occur when you work more than 13 hours a day without a break at the weekend - I literally loved doing it and discovered a new passion. Today I only want to learn more, if possible from professionals, in order to be able to lead a bigger project one day.  

So I am now a candidate for the Cnam-Enjmin gameplay programmer degree, and I am looking for a video game studio that would accept to sign a three-year apprenticeship contract with me. If you are, dear reader, possibly an employer looking for an apprentice, I hope that my projects playable on this page will convince you of my skills.
