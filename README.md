# Hello to you dear visitor,   
  
  

First of all, I welcome you on my Itch.io (and GitHub) page and I sincerely hope that you will find pleasure here by playing to my games because I took care of them for that (click [here](https://kayrosgames.itch.io/) to see my itch.io page).   

I'm an actor who has turned to the field of video game programming. Having tried several disciplines, I have what you could call an atypical background that makes me a versatile person.  

After obtaining my Master of research in Philosophy, with the production of a thesis on the theme of video games (co-directed by Mathieu Triclot), I worked as an actor for several years and I was lucky enough to participate in more than ten shows. I think I have talent in comedy, because I work hard, and also because I have a certain sensitivity. But the difficulty to live well from this profession, in addition to the pandemic, made me decide to find a field where I could have a decent living.  

Since the recruitment of programmers has been on the rise for a long time, and more and more, but also to stay in an artistic field, video games appeared to me as a possible suitable field. Although it is not the field that recruits the most in the informatic industry, having learned to program for video games will always allow me to branch out if needed. Moreover, I was brought up on video games. I got my first console (a Game Boy Color) at the age of five, and it was the beginning of a long love story.  

After some researchs, I spotted a training program offered by the Cnam-Enjmin Nouvelle-Aquitaine, a three-year programming science degree "video games course", in work-study. This training seemed to be the most appropriate to my situation but the problem was that the selection is hard and that you have to find a work-study program in a company to be accepted, even though I had no programming background.  

So I rolled up my sleeves, and started at the beginning of September 2021 to learn to program with the Python language. I had fun making small playful programs but I quickly decided to follow a four-month certification training delivered by *Gaming Campus* (in partnership with *Gamecodeur*) in order to have the necessary level for the Enjmin and a chance to get an apprenticeship contract (this training cost me 2800‚Ç¨, which were at my own expenses). Even though the course was very demanding (not everyone succeeded) - and I had to be careful with tendonitis that can occur when you work more than 13 hours a day without a break at the weekend - I literally loved doing it and discovered a new passion. Today I only want to learn more, if possible from professionals, in order to be able to lead a bigger project one day.  

I finally came in first in my school's competition, and I got my apprenticeship contract. I worked for five months at *Nereid Games*. However, due to the strong recession of the mobile games market, my company had to stop its activities in February 2023 and terminate my contract prematurely.

I am now looking again for a video game studio that would accept to sign an apprenticeship contract with me for the time I have left in my studies and so that I can continue them. If you are, dear reader, possibly an employer looking for an apprentice, I hope that my projects playable on this page will convince you of my skills.
